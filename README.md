# Task
Definition: create a simple code highlighting web app where users can login/signup and create code snippets from one of the available languages. Users can save that snippet as private or public, and can later edit that snippet. Users can also search for other users and look at their profile and public code snippets. No specific user interface is required for this task, a simple web app with a default white background but with working functionality is more than enough
